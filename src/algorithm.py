# input:
# arr - a numpy array. In main.py, this array is called X. It contains an array of length 2 arrays.
# These are the coords of all the points.
# The first pair of numbers are the coords for the landing pad (aka the starting point).
#
# order - This will be a python set of numbers. (sets don't allow duplicate items which is epic.)
# This set contains the order in which the different points will be visited on this path. The set will
# start with 1 since the starting point will always be the landing pad.
#
# output:
# output the total distance of the path the drone will take given this order.
